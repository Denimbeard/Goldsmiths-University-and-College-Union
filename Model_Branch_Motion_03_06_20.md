# Full support for casualised workers’ Goldsmiths UCU’s marking boycott
 
## This branch notes that:
 
> - The Higher Education (HE) sector is in crisis. The material consequences of ‘casualisation’ is becoming ever-clearer. 
> - Goldsmiths management have already made significant cuts to casualised workers during the summer. They have recently announced a restructure that will very likely result in compulsory redundancies among hourly paid teaching staff. 
> - In response, Goldsmiths UCU will take industrial action from 4 January, beginning with an assessment boycott during the January marking period. 
> - Punitive deductions for this action will hit hourly paid staff hardest. Casualised staff look to lose significant windfall payments by participating in this action. It is, therefore, crucial that casualised staff have access to dedicated financial support during this period.    
 
## Branch resolves:
 
> - Refuse to take on any work that might diminish the strength of the boycott
> - Publicise the GUCU’s campaign, and send to all branches asking for messages of solidarity and support. 
> - To donate an amount to be decided to the Goldsmiths Mutual Aid fund that will provide dedicated financial support to casualised members of staff participating in the marking boycott.  
> - That the branch make contact with the campaign to discuss support measures, and possible collective actions.
