# Auto-reply from members taking part in the action:

I am currently engaged in an Assessment Boycott and other Actions Short of a Strike along with other members in Goldsmiths University and College Union (GUCU). 

## We are currently in dispute with our employer (Goldsmiths) over two key issues: 

 1. protecting staff from redundancies relating to an ongoing restructure of the institution, and 
    
 2. related ‘cost-saving measures’ that have left us without adequate staffing and without adequate working conditions for providing a safe and fair environment for student learning.

Negotiations between GUCU representatives and senior management are ongoing, and we are making every possible effort to reach a resolution. As part of this action, UCU members have been advised not to give formal feedback, marks, cover for absent colleagues or undertake voluntary activities.

If you are a student, you may discuss this further with your module tutors, your Departmental student or staff union representatives.

Should you wish to support staff, you can find a letter template to send to Frances Corner and the senior management team here: [Student support info](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOQgjt4lsnLQle_da6JBBrHIDoRHNnFOrmeloPIDikg/edit)
