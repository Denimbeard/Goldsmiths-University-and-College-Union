# Goldsmiths University and College Union

Goldsmiths UCU is in dispute with our employer over a reduction in staffing levels and “staff cost control” measures taken as part of the ‘Recovery Plan’ which have led to huge increases in workload, reduction in AL/GTT budgets and further inequality. 

The next phase of the restructure threatens more compulsory redundancies despite net student figures holding up and alternative non-staff cost saving opportunities having been identified by the Independent Business Review carried out by KPMG. 

The review itself is also wasting precious resources on KPMG – almost the same amount “saved” by cutting our casualised colleagues in the summer.

# Timeline:

- ## [Monday, 16th November 2020](http://goldsmithsucu.org/2020/11/12/gucu-ballot-for-action-starts-16-nov-branch-meeting/):
  - ### GUCU is holding a branch meeting on the same day at 1pm for all members in order to discuss in full all of the issues at stake.
  - #### Guests:
    - James Richards of Heriot-Watt University UCU
    - Professors Forum

  - The branch is focused on Action Short of a Strike and a Marking and Assessment Boycott, but it is important that we have all possible means of opposition available – namely, action short of a strike, a marking and assessment boycott, and as a last resort, strike action should we need it. As a local dispute, the branch democratically controls what action we take and when, and all members will have a voice regarding any proposed escalation.
  - The cut off day to send your ballot is: Wednesday 9th of December, 2020.
  
- ## [Tuesday, 15th of December 2020](http://goldsmithsucu.org/2020/12/15/a-solid-vote-for-action-branch-meeting-to-discuss-next-steps/):
  - The results of the GUCU industrial ballot are in.
    - With a recorded turn out of 55.8% of members:
       - 90.7% voted for Action Short of a Strike (including assessment boycott)
       - 72.5% voted for strike action.
  - These exceptional results are an unequivocal rejection of the path the College is taking, as was the recent 87% vote of ‘no confidence’ in the current management. It is only through action that we will win any ground to push back on the these chaotic and damaging restructuring plans.

- ## [Wednesday, 13th of January 2021](http://goldsmithsucu.org/2021/01/13/parents-and-carers-motion/):
  - ### GUCU Resolution – Support for Carers During Lockdown. 
    - Passed at GUCU branch meeting 13 Jan 2021
  - ### This Branch Demands:
    - That Goldsmiths adopt a policy, like other University of London institutions, that enables and grants carers furlough requests on full pay, 
    - That this an institution-wide policy is put into place by January 20th, which provides central funds to make up those 20% (plus NI) of salary costs not covered by the Furlough Scheme,
    - That Senior Management then approve budgets from departments to employ AL and GTT staff to cover staff carers on furlough.
