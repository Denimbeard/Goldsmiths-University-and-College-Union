# Goldsmiths University and College Union

Goldsmiths UCU is in dispute with our employer over a reduction in staffing levels and “staff cost control” measures taken as part of the ‘Recovery Plan’ which have led to huge increases in workload, reduction in AL/GTT budgets and further inequality. 

The next phase of the restructure threatens more compulsory redundancies despite net student figures holding up and alternative non-staff cost saving opportunities having been identified by the Independent Business Review carried out by KPMG. 

The review itself is also wasting precious resources on KPMG – almost the same amount “saved” by cutting our casualised colleagues in the summer.
