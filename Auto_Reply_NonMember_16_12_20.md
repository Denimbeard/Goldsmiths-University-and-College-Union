Dear student,

Thank you for raising your concern. You have not received your grades or feedback as staff members who are part of the University and College Union (UCU), including a large number of academic and some professional staff, are 

## Currently in dispute with our employer (Goldsmiths) over two key issues: 

 1. protecting staff from redundancies relating to an ongoing restructure of the institution
 2. and related ‘cost-saving measures’ that have left them without adequate staffing and without adequate working conditions for providing a safe and fair environment for student learning.

### Negotiations between GUCU representatives and senior management are ongoing, and they are making every possible effort to reach a resolution.

As part of this action, UCU members have been advised not to give formal feedback, marks, cover for absent colleagues or undertake voluntary activities.

Should you wish to support staff, you can sign this [Open Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOQgjt4lsnLQle_da6JBBrHIDoRHNnFOrmeloPIDikg/edit). You may also discuss this further with your module tutors or Departmental staff or student representatives.
